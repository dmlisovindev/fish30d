# Fish 3.0D
An old student project of mine, recreated in Go for the purpose of training (and having fun). It is a mini game where you play as a small fish that has to eat smaller fish to grow a bit bigger, and avoid being eaten by bigger fish.
It is meant to be a single executable file, with all relevant resources already embedded into it.

Version 3.0 since there were two previous versions (written in C++ and C# respectively), but, unfortunately, I lost the source code for them.
